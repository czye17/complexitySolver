# complexitySolver

Script to solve complexity optimization problems.

Code is adapted from https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~vdbrand/complexity/ by Jan van den Brand and updated to include most recent bounds on fast matrix multiplication (`More Asymmetry Yields Faster Matrix Multiplication` by Alman, Duan, Vassilevska-Williams, Xu, Xu, Zhou SODA 2025)

Packages required: numpy and scipy.

Run `python approx_apsp_solver.py`
